# Testing Infrastructure

This document describes the testing infrastructure for the MCP-B NPM packages monorepo.

## Overview

We use **Playwright** for end-to-end testing of browser-based transports, which is the appropriate choice because:

1. **Real Browser Environment**: MCP transports rely on browser APIs like `postMessage`, Chrome runtime messaging, and DOM events
2. **Integration Testing**: Tests the complete communication flow between MCP servers and clients
3. **User Perspective**: Validates behavior from the user's perspective, not just unit-level correctness
4. **Visual Debugging**: Playwright UI mode makes it easy to see what's happening in tests

## Test Architecture

### E2E Tests with Playwright

Located in `/e2e/`, the test infrastructure includes:

- **Test App** (`e2e/test-app/`): A Vite + TypeScript application that demonstrates Tab Transport usage
- **Test Suites** (`e2e/tests/`): Playwright tests that validate transport behavior
- **Configuration**: Playwright config with Chromium browser support

### Test App Features

The test application provides:

1. **MCP Server**: Implements a counter service with 4 tools:
   - `incrementCounter` - Increment counter by 1
   - `decrementCounter` - Decrement counter by 1
   - `resetCounter` - Reset counter to 0
   - `getCounter` - Get current counter value

2. **MCP Client**: Connects to the server in the same browser context using TabClientTransport

3. **Interactive UI**: Manual testing interface with:
   - Server start/stop controls
   - Client connect/disconnect controls
   - Tool execution buttons
   - Event log
   - Counter display

4. **Programmatic API**: Exposed `testApp` object for Playwright to control

## Running Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (from repo root)
pnpm install

# Build packages
pnpm build

# Install Playwright browsers
pnpm --filter mcp-e2e-tests exec playwright install chromium

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests (headless)
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e

# Run with Playwright UI (recommended for development)
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see the browser)
pnpm test:e2e:headed

# Debug mode (step through tests)
pnpm test:e2e:debug

# View test report
pnpm --filter mcp-e2e-tests test:report
```

### Manual Testing

Run the test app manually to experiment with transports:

```bash
# Start test app dev server
pnpm --filter mcp-tab-transport-test-app dev

# Open http://localhost:5173 in browser
```

Then use the UI to:
1. Start MCP Server
2. Connect MCP Client
3. List available tools
4. Execute counter operations
5. Monitor the event log

## Test Coverage

The Playwright test suite validates:

### Basic Functionality
- ✅ Application loads correctly
- ✅ MCP server starts successfully
- ✅ MCP client connects to server
- ✅ Tools can be listed via MCP protocol

### Tool Execution
- ✅ Increment counter via MCP tool call
- ✅ Decrement counter via MCP tool call
- ✅ Reset counter via MCP tool call
- ✅ Get counter value via MCP tool call

### Advanced Scenarios
- ✅ Multiple rapid tool calls (concurrency)
- ✅ Client disconnect and reconnect
- ✅ Server stop and restart
- ✅ Programmatic API usage

### Transport Validation
- ✅ TabServerTransport accepts connections
- ✅ TabClientTransport establishes connections
- ✅ postMessage communication works
- ✅ JSON-RPC messages flow correctly
- ✅ State persistence across reconnections

## CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests to `main`
- Pushes to `main`

**Steps**:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build all packages
3. Install Playwright browsers
4. Run E2E tests
5. Upload test reports and screenshots

**Artifacts**:
- Playwright HTML report (30 days retention)
- Test results and screenshots (7 days retention)

## Writing New Tests

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    // Setup code
  });

  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange
    await page.click('#start-server');

    // Act
    await page.click('#some-action');

    // Assert
    await expect(page.locator('#result')).toHaveText('Expected');
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use Data Attributes**: The test app uses `data-status`, `data-counter`, etc. for reliable selectors
2. **Wait for State**: Use `await expect().toHaveText()` with timeouts instead of arbitrary waits
3. **Test User Flows**: Write tests from the user's perspective, not implementation details
4. **Check Logs**: Verify operations appear in the event log
5. **Parallel Safe**: Ensure tests don't depend on shared state

### Testing Extension Transports

For Chrome Extension transports, you'll need to:

1. Create a test extension directory
2. Use Playwright's `chromium.launchPersistentContext()` with extension support
3. Test cross-extension communication

Example (future implementation):

```typescript
test('should connect via ExtensionTransport', async () => {
  const context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext('', {
    args: [
      `--disable-extensions-except=/path/to/test-extension`,
      `--load-extension=/path/to/test-extension`,
    ],
  });

  const page = await context.newPage();
  // Test extension transport
});
```

## Debugging Tests

### Playwright UI Mode (Recommended)

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

Features:
- Visual test execution
- Time travel debugging
- DOM snapshots at each step
- Network activity logs
- Console output
- Pick locator tool

### Debug Mode

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:debug
```

Features:
- Playwright Inspector
- Step through tests line by line
- Set breakpoints
- Inspect page state
- Test selector playground

### Screenshots and Traces

Failed tests automatically capture:

- **Screenshots**: Saved in `e2e/test-results/`
- **Traces**: Viewable in Playwright UI or via `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip`

To always capture traces:

```typescript
// In playwright.config.ts
use: {
  trace: 'on', // 'on' | 'off' | 'on-first-retry' | 'retain-on-failure'
}
```

## Performance

- **Typical test suite runtime**: 30-60 seconds
- **Test parallelization**: Enabled by default (can be configured in `playwright.config.ts`)
- **CI optimization**: Uses single worker on CI for stability

## Future Enhancements

### Unit Tests

Consider adding Vitest for unit testing individual transport methods:

```bash
pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 -w
```

Benefits:
- Faster feedback loop
- Test edge cases without browser
- Measure code coverage

### Additional E2E Tests

Planned test scenarios:

- [ ] WebSocket transport testing
- [ ] Extension transport testing (requires Chrome extension setup)
- [ ] Multi-tab communication scenarios
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Visual Regression Testing

Add visual regression tests using Playwright's screenshot comparison:

```typescript
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('counter-view.png');
```

### Code Coverage

Integrate coverage reporting with Playwright:

```typescript
// In playwright.config.ts
use: {
  coverage: {
    enabled: true,
    provider: 'v8',
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Playwright Installation Issues

If browser installation fails:

```bash
# Install browsers with system dependencies
pnpm --filter mcp-e2e-tests exec playwright install --with-deps

# Or install specific browser
pnpm --filter mcp-e2e-tests exec playwright install chromium
```

### Port Conflicts

If port 5173 is in use:

```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill

# Or change port in playwright.config.ts and vite.config.ts
```

### Timeout Issues

Increase timeout in test or config:

```typescript
// In test
test('slow test', async ({ page }) => {
  test.setTimeout(60000); // 60 seconds
});

// In config
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 60000,
});
```

### CI Failures

Common CI issues:

1. **Missing browsers**: Ensure `playwright install` runs before tests
2. **Race conditions**: Use `expect().toHaveText()` instead of `waitForTimeout()`
3. **Flaky tests**: Add retry logic or fix timing issues
