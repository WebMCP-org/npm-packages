### Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification with **required package scopes** for clarity in our monorepo:

#### Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

#### Types

- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `test:` Adding missing tests
- `build:` Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci:` Changes to CI configuration
- `chore:` Other changes that don't modify src or test files
